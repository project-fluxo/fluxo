# Fluxo

FLUXO is a numerical tool to solve linear and nonlinear advection diffusion equations, for example the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, 
the resistive magneto-hydrodynamic equations and others. 

FLUXO is based on a novel Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element
Method (DGSEM), which allows for high-order of accuracy 
and fully unstructured hexahedral meshes. The volume terms are formulated in a specific subcell flux based form, which allows the construction of 
entropy stable as well as kinetic energy preserving discretisations. 
The solver is parallelized very efficiently and scales up
to hundreds of thousand cores.

FLUXO is a spin-off of the FLEXI code (https://github.com/flexi-framework/flexi) 
that is developed at the Institute for Aero- and Gasdynamics at University Stuttgart 
in the group of Claus-Dieter Munz.
