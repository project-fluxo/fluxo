## running tests
after having built the meshes (in ../meshes) before executing the tests!

If you have compiled with linearscalaradvection equation, use:
```
python runtest.py ../../build/bin/fluxo parameter_freestream_linadv.ini
```
else, replace parameter file for the appropriate equation system used.
